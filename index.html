	<div class="pagecontent"><span class="mdrender"><p>Entertainment is Important. Capital-I Important. The entertainment we create gives the audience<br/>
a window into how we see the world on a fundimental level. The entertainment we consume moulds our minds and shapes our hearts,<br/>
and directly influences how we relate to others and act upon the world. Perhaps this is why we've seen, time and again, technological and social advances<br/>
that mimic entertainment that came before. Maybe this is why propaganda made using entertainment methods and techology<br/>
have been so effective at helping to win wars... and helping at propagating some of the worst travesties in human history. Fortunately<br/>
entertainment, properly recorded, is durable and persistent, and the entertainment of the past is essential when trying<br/>
to understand those who came before us. So, too, will the entertainment of the present be essential for understanding <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>BlakWurm Entertainment is dedicated to helping people create and consume entertainment. Currently, we're working on several<br/>
RPG-related projects, which will help small groups of friends more efficiently experience each other's imaginations and<br/>
creations.</p></span></div>
